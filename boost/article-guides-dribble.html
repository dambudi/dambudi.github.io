                    <p class="date">Lexis Walsh | March 14, 2021</p>
                    <p>Boost wants to help you become a better Rocket League player. Our training guru Llexis develops
                        custom Training Packs for the Rocketeers community. Last time he showed you how to improve your
                        aerials.</p>
                    <p>In our second training pack you will learn how to dribble like a pro. Here’s the download code
                        for the Aerial Variety Pack: 9863-6D3C-af72-A7E3</p>
                    <h3>Carry the ball for buzzer-beaters</h3>
                    <p>This extended training pack is for anyone who’s trying to learn to dribble the ball or push their
                        current skill level before moving onto workshop packs. It will help with the initial stages of
                        dribbling the ball – all the way up to carrying the ball the full length of the pitch for those
                        0 second buzzer-beaters.</p>
                    <p>Those who are already comfortable with dribbling can also use this pack as an opportunity to
                        practice their flicking and their ground-to-air dribbling.</p>
                    <p>The initial levels, the ball will be floating in-front of you. At this height, you will be able
                        to drive into it and easily take it on your roof. This is to get comfortable with balancing the
                        ball on the roof of the car and carrying it a short distance while watching the ball’s ground
                        indicator.</p>

                <div class="article">
                    <h3>Dribbling after the ball bounces off the wall</h3>
                    <p>After the first few levels, you will be introduced to different methods of starting a dribbling
                        play. This will be from a ball rolling straight towards you, rolling by the side of you,
                        bouncing off your body or the wall first, or falling from above.</p>
                    <p>During these earlier levels you will need to pay most attention to the ball’s ground indicator
                        and be comfortable with transitioning from ball-cam on to off during the dribble setup.
                        Switching to ball-cam off is a big advantage while dribbling as you will be able to concentrate
                        on the ball indicator, where your opponents are, and where the goal is all at the same time.
                        You’ll also have a full view of your car while setting up a flick.</p>
                    <p>You will then be challenged with turning while dribbling. In these levels, the ball will be
                        passed to you while facing away from net. You have to make adjustments while carrying the ball
                        to the goal, instead of just driving straight forward.</p>
                    <h3>How to catch a falling ball</h3>
                    <p>Towards the half way-point of the pack you will start drills that require a first touch and then
                        a recovery or a quick return to the ground. Such levels will be hitting a ball that’s floating
                        in the air and then catching it afterwards. This will train you set up dribble plays from even
                        more situations and also how to catch a falling ball.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sidebar"></div>

                <div class="article-img">
                    <img src="images/article-guides-a2-dribble.jpg" alt="In-game screenshot of player dribbling ball">
                    <p class="caption">Dribbling in Rocket League / Rocketeers</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sidebar"></div>

                <div class="article">
                    <p>Lastly, the later stages of the pack will have awkward setups. This will be in the form of the
                        ball hitting you from the side, behind you, or the ball being far out of reach. These drills
                        will maximise your ability to setup, recover, and then carry the ball the full length of the
                        pitch.</p>
                    <p>After completing this training pack, you will then no-longer see zero seconds on the clock as the
                        end of the match, but instead as your time to shine and score one more.</p>
