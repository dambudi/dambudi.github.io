                    <h2>It's no secret that human activity has made a destructive impact on the health of the Earth.</h2>
                    <p>The effects of the climate crisis are growing to be more devastating and its implications affect essentially every aspect of life. Increasing global temperatures have led to more powerful natural disasters costing human lives and rising sea levels threatening livelihoods.</p>
                    <p>Here in Aotearoa, we are also quite vulnerable. As an island nation, many of the country's population who live near the coastlines will experience frequent flooding, while people living inland will experience more wildfires.</p>

                    <h2>The trees and the forests</h2>
                    <p>The trees and forests of Aotearoa play an important role in the biodiversity of our beautiful environment.</p>
                    <p>Trees absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and release oxygen into the atmosphere for us to breathe. They also perform another important process called "sequestration" by storing the carbon in their biomass. This sequestration is one way of mitigating the effects of climate change, as it takes away the harmful greenhouse gas of carbon dioxide which would otherwise contribute to raising the temperatures of the planet.</p>
                    <p>We have gathered data from New Zealand detailing the changes to Aotearoa's forests that have
                        occurred
                        over the past 25 years.</p>

                            <p>Organisms in soil produce carbon dioxide in a process called soil respiration. This is a part of the natural carbon cycle. Plants also respire carbon dioxide from their roots below ground.

                            <p>Notably, cultivated timber produces more carbon dioxide than natural forests. Most of the carbon dioxide that was stored in a tree is released into the atmosphere when it is cut down. Therefore, cutting trees down is a fundamental part of cultivating timber.</p>
                            <p>This shows just how damaging the clearing of forests is for our carbon emissions. We can't rely on planting trees that will eventually be cut down.</p>

                            <p>Trees sequester and store carbon in their biomass. This includes stems, branches and leaves above ground and root systems below ground. Mature trees in natural forests store a lot of carbon, which helps offset our carbon emissions.</p>

                    <h2>Our forests are amazing.</h2>
                    <p>As you can see, the forests of New Zealand play an important role in the biodiversity of our beautiful environment. Trees help the planet by absorbing harmful carbon emissions and cooling the earth. As important natural habitats, forests support many of New Zealand’s ecosystems including native species of birds and plants. Forests also prevent many natural disasters such as floods and generally improve our health.</p>
                    <p>New Zealand is known for its clean, green image of clean rivers and green scenery. Internationally, the country is seen as a natural paradise. The reality, however, is rather different in many ways.</p>
                    <p>Much of our native forest has been lost to farmland and urban development since humans settled here centuries ago. This loss of forest has proven to be devastating, especially considering the ability of forests to combat growing carbon emissions. To understand how our environment has degraded to this point, we must have a look at a timeline of New Zealand’s forests.</p>

                    <p>For most of its history, the land of New Zealand was untouched by humans. Māori only settled here around 700 years ago in the 1200s, a relatively recent time ago. Having been one of the last landmasses to be discovered, the forests of New Zealand show a clear example of the effects of mankind on the surrounding environment. </p>
                    <p>The landscape of New Zealand was historically dominated by forests with trees covering almost every bit of land - a sea of green of sorts. Native forests covered 80% of the land before humans arrived. The remainder of the land was made up of mountainous areas where trees couldn’t grow.</p>

                    <h2>1840</h2>
                    <p>When Māori settled in New Zealand they started altering the landscape. Over the next few centuries, a considerable amount of forest cover was lost on the coastlines. Māori settled in these areas and burned 6.7 million hectares of forest.</p>
                    <p>By the time of European arrival around 1840, the amount of forest cover had reduced to 53%. Much of the country was still covered in dense native forests around then, although this would change with the arrival of European settlers.</p>

                    <h2>2021</h2>
                    <p>The deforestation Māori did over some 600 years, European settlers did even more within a century. Many of New Zealand’s dense forests were slashed and burned to prepare land for agriculture and urban development. Trees were cut down to supply construction for a growing population.</p>
                    <p>Farmers were paid incentives by the government to clear trees to make way for farmland. Many settlers were granted land by the government if they could clear a sufficient amount of forest from their land. Much of this land was stolen from Māori by the government, an act that violated the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>

                    <p>To the colonists of the past, the drastic landscape changes were considered a “triumph of progress”. Forests were seen as less productive and profitable than the farmland that replaced them.</p>
                    <p>Today, forests cover only 30% of New Zealand’s landscape and native forests only 24%. Half of the total land that makes up New Zealand is now farmland, forests cover only pockets of land around the country - a stark contrast from only a few centuries before where forests covered almost every inch they could.</p>

                            <p>Since the boom of deforestation in the 1800s, New Zealand has changed its attitude towards its forests.</p>
                            <p>Nowadays timber companies must prove their practices are sustainable. The Scenery Preservation Act of 1903 was the earliest legislation that sought to preserve forests as part of the landscape’s beauty for tourism purposes. Once threatened by logging, Pureora Forest Park in the North Island was saved from destruction in 1978 and is now one of the largest parcels of native forest.</p>
                            <p>Other forests around the country such as Waipoua, Hinewai and the Waitakere Ranges have also gained legal protections over the last century.</p>

                            <p>Conservation of forests is not such an issue in New Zealand anymore, though the regeneration of lost forests is still important. In the past 30 years, more trees have been planted than cut down. There was a particular boom in tree planting in the 1990s, though this has slowed down in recent years.

                            <p>This decline of afforestation coupled with an increase in deforestation is detrimental to New Zealand’s carbon emissions. Many trees of the 1990s boom were planted for cultivation purposes. As such, when the trees from this “wall of wood” reach the age of maturity within the next decade, we will see another boom of deforestation. This highlights the importance of planting new permanent forests.

                    <p>Although trees are not the only solution for climate change, they do prove to play an important role in absorbing carbon emissions and sustaining surrounding ecosystems. Therefore it’s more important than ever to conserve our existing forests and restore those that have been lost over time.</p>
                    <p>Regenerating forests isn’t all about numbers and planting seeds in the ground. There are a lot of factors that should be considered. First, not just any tree can be planted. Planting monocultures (only one species) can actually damage the surrounding ecosystem. The best practice is to plant native species of trees.</p>
                    <p>There is also a difference between planting plantations and permanent forests. The trees in plantation forests are planted specifically to be harvested in the future. On the other hand, permanent forests are replanted to permanently recover biodiversity and ecosystems.</p>

                    <p>The One Billion Trees fund calculates that the potential carbon sequestration of their trees is approximately 2.6 million tonnes by 2030 and 11.4 million tonnes by 2050. This would counteract around a third of New Zealand’s annual agricultural emissions.</p>

                    <h2>You can help!</h2>
                    <p>Of course, replanting trees isn’t the silver bullet to solving climate change. It is only a portion of the larger effort to decrease carbon emissions and it should take place alongside other methods of mitigation. Nonetheless, the health and restoration of our native forests is important and should not be ignored.</p>
                    <p>As an individual, you can also contribute to the initiative. Donate to tree-planting programmes or plant trees with your local community. Avoid buying environmentally harmful products, and try to shop ethically and environmentally instead. Engage with your local government and vote for politicians who champion climate action.</p>
                    <p>There is a lot you can do to help save our forests and our Earth.</p>
